# Gradle `dotnet` plugin

Gradle wrapper to the `dotnet` binary.

## Prerequisites

.NET core must be installed. This plugin does not come with .NET core pre-bundled. If the sonar scanner tasks are used, this add-on must be installed separately using the `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-sonarscanner`
